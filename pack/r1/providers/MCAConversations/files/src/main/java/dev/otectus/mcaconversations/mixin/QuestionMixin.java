/**
 * Filters the answers MCA is about to offer: hides our injected {@code main} menu answer when the
 * configured {@link dev.otectus.mcaconversations.HubEntryMode} says it should not be offered.
 *
 * <p>The answer itself is added by a datapack file, which is the right mechanism for *adding* a
 * button — but MCA decides which answers a player may pick purely from {@code Constraint}s, a
 * fixed vocabulary with no notion of our config. A result whose conditions all score zero is
 * still listed, because {@code getValidAnswers} filters on constraints alone and never consults
 * result scores. So removing the button at runtime genuinely requires an injection; this is the
 * narrowest one available and it touches exactly one answer name in exactly one question.
 *
 * <p>Modes: {@code ADDITIVE} keeps the answer (MCA's Chat is untouched, the hub gets its own
 * button); {@code REPLACE} drops it because MCA's Chat already leads to the hub and two entries
 * would be duplicates; {@code HIDDEN} drops it because the UI entry is switched off.
 *
 * <p><b>Two targets, one jar</b> — see {@link NetworkHandlerMixin} for why both MCA package roots
 * are listed and why {@link Pseudo} is set. The question's own name is read through a
 * {@link Shadow}ed {@code getName()} rather than the old {@code ((Question) (Object) this)} cast,
 * which would have named the MCA type this mixin must stay agnostic about.
 *
 * <p>Server-side: {@code getValidAnswers} takes a {@code ServerPlayer}, so this loads no client
 * class and is registered in the common {@code mixins} list. {@code remap = false} (MCA's own
 * method) and {@code require = 0} — if MCA reshapes the method the button simply stays visible
 * rather than the game failing to start.
